# Unmaintained Projects

> Projects needing some love.

Sadly some awesome OpenStreetMap projects out there are unmaintained. Those are listed here.

If you are a developer, consider looking through those projects and adopting one to give it another chance at life! If you've revived one of these projects as either a new maintainer of the existing repo or as a fork, please [open a new issue](https://github.com/osmlab/awesome-openstreetmap/issues/new) so we can move it to [the main list](./README.md)! :smiley:
